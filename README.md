## About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an electro-mechanical image aquisition device focused on ease of use and long term repeatability as well as a HMI touch screen carputer for a 2009 Chevy Tahoe.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning every day, as any programming professional should.

- 💬 Ask me about real life manufacturing and ERP requirements or common complaints.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I do this for the pure joy of making functional devices with elegant code, learning every day, and total control to adjust things to my liking.
